Natue's IT jobs page
====

The jobs page is a simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog, the form data is
posted into [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com) and the blog uses
[CodeShip](https://www.codeship.io) to continuous deploy the generated static
website into [Amazon's S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Any push to master is automatically deployed into production, so please, work
on branches.
